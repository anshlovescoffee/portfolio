                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hey There! My name is Ansh Anand, a Computer Science student at The University
                     of Texas at Dallas. I'm really passionate about building 
                    cool things with code whether thatâ€™s web apps, AI models, or automating 
                    something just so I don't have to do it manually twice. You can spot me
                     at your local cafe (I love coffee if you couldn't tell by my domain). 
                     
                     
                </p>
                <p>
                     When I'm not coding I'm usually out exploring a new area-I have a big love for travel! 
                     At the end of the day my goal is simple: to build things that make life more functional, enjoyable, 
                     or at the very least, less annoying. Let's change the world one line of code at a time!</p>
